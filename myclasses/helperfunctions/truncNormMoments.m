%
% Calculates the truncated zeroth, first, and second moments of a
% univariate normal distribution.
% 
% Much special care is taken to ensure numerical stability over a wide
% range of values, which is particularly important when calculating tail
% probabilities.
%
% there is use of the scaled complementary error function erfcx, etc.
% The actual equations can be found in Jawitz 2004 or Cunningham PhD thesis
% 2009 (Chap 4, Eq 4.6 (note typo in first... alpha and beta are swapped)).
% -This is to be used by Cunningham and Hennig, EP MGP paper.
%
% KEY: normcdf and erf and erfc are unstable when their arguments get big.
% If we are interested in tail probabilities (we are), and if we care about
% logZ more than Z (we do), then normcf/erf/erfc are limited in their
% usefulness.  Instead we can use erfcx(z) = exp(z^2)erfc(z), which has
% some foibles of its own.  The key is to consider that erfcx is stable close to erfc==0, but
% less stable close to erfc==1.  Since the Gaussian is symmetric
% about 0, we can choose to flip the calculation around the origin
% to improve our stability.  For example, if a is -inf, and b is
% -100, then a naive application will return 0.  However, we can
% just flip this around to be erfc(b)= erfc(100), which we can then
% STABLY calculate with erfcx(100)...neat.  This leads to many
% different cases, when either argument is inf or not.
% Also there may appear to be some redundancy here, but it is also
% worth noting that a less detailed application of erfcx can be
% troublesome, as erfcx(-big numbers) = Inf, which wreaks havoc on
% a lot of the calculations.  The cases below treat this when
% necessary.
%
% NOTE: works with singletons or vectors only!
%
% The code is very fast as stands, so loops and other cases are used
% (instead of vectorizing) so that things are most readable.
